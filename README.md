# Friday

## Summary
Friday on the web!

Python used to create adaption of solitaire card game, Friday.
It's a game about understanding chance and probability of cards to optimize your chances of survival.
The player commands Robinson Cruesoe as his advisor, Friday.
A deck of cards represents Cruesoe's attributes, and another deck as a variety of challenges.

During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck.
If defeated, a hazard will become a fight card and is added to the players deck.
If failed the player will lose life tokens but also get the opportunity to remove harmful attributes from Cruesoe's fight deck.
Finally the player will use their optimized fight deck to defeat two evil pirate ships allowing Robinson Crusoe to escape the island!

## But Why Raymond?

I wanted to work on an app using Python and Django. I assumed this would be a good way to test my skills and learn both. Go hard or go home.

I was inspired by a fun game recreated on the web called Spyfall, so I naturally chose a fun solitaire game to design, and hopefully I'll finish it.
