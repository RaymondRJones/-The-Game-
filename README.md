# Friday
Python used to create adaption of solitaire card game, Friday
Friday is a game about understanding chance and probability of cards to optimize your chances of survival. The player commands Robinson Cruesoe as his advisor Friday. A deck of cards represents Cruesoe's attributes, and another deck as a variety of challenges.

During a turn the player will attempt to defeat hazard cards by playing fight cards from their deck. If defeated, a hazard will become a fight card and is added to the players deck. If failed the player will lose life tokens but also get the opportunity to remove played cards from their fight deck. Finally the player will use their optimized fight deck to defeat two evil pirate ships allowing Robinson Crusoe to escape the island!
